# Stock.Predictor-AI


Welcome to StockPredictor AI ‚Äî a school-based collaborative project where we're building a stock market prediction system that uses real historical data to forecast future stock prices. 
The final product? A clean and interactive web app that makes stock predictions accessible, insightful, and hopefully a little less intimidating.

## üí° What‚Äôs This All About?

This app lets you enter a stock symbol (like `AAPL` for Apple or `TSLA` for Tesla), pulls historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance**, and gives you a prediction of where the stock might be heading ‚Äì along with trend direction and confidence scores.

### Core Goals:
- Train machine learning models (starting simple, building up to LSTM & Transformers).
- Create a user-friendly web interface for inputting stock symbols and viewing predictions.
- Practice teamwork, problem-solving, and applying real-world ML skills ‚Äî while balancing school!


## üöÄ Planned Features 

### ‚úÖ MVP Features
- Input a stock ticker symbol (e.g. `GOOG`, `MSFT`)
- Fetch historical data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`
- Clean, preprocess, and structure the data for modeling
- Use ML models to predict future stock prices
- Show prediction results with interactive charts and trend info

### üîú Bonus Features (Stretch Goals)
- User accounts & saved predictions
- Additional AI-generated trend/risk insights
- Confidence level scoring
